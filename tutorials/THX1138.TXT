THX 1138
original by Brandon Turok (86)

Well, thx1138 is a very very simple game. You just steer the line around
the screen and dont hit anything. The controls are the arrow keys and you
can press either clear or mode to quit.

The actual game is nothing special, but...

Its only 601 bytes big! I thought that this was pretty small considering i
did no optimizing and 79 bytes of that is just the text ascii characters.
well, have fun.

By the way, I dont program much 82 assembly, but i love my 86! that is 
what my page is about. If you are looking for an 82, dont even bother, my
page is strictly 86.
  Have fun. hasta luego
