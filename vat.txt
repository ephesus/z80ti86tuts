TI-86 Variable Stuff

Variable data starts on RAM page 2 (0 and 1 are system data, etc.)
The VAT (Variable Access table starts the end of RAM page 7 (C000) and builds
downward. There is a VAT entry for each variable. VAT entry format is:

Bytes	Description
1	Type byte
3	absolute pointer to variable data, see end of this document if
	you don't know about absolute addresses yet...
1	seems to be always 0, maybe is flags byte?
1	name length
<8	name

NOTE: this is backwards, the type byte is at the highest address, the name
is at the lowest address.

Absolute Addresses (RAM)

000000-00FFFF	page 0, offset 0000-FFFF
010000-013FFF	page 1, offset 8000-BFFF
014000-017FFF	page 2, offset 8000-BFFF
018000-01BFFF	page 3, offset 8000-BFFF
01C000-01FFFF	page 4, offset 8000-BFFF
020000-023FFF	page 5, offset 8000-BFFF
024000-027FFF	page 6, offset 8000-BFFF
028000-02FFFF	page 7, offset 8000-FFFF

NOTE: if the most significant byte is greater than 2, the TI-86 ROM v1.2
acts as if it were 2.
