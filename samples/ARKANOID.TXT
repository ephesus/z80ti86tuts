Arkanoid is a classic ATARI game I believe (ive never played it) where 
you try to destroy the bricks at the top by hitting them with the ball
which you aim with the paddle.

This version has 4 bonuses: extra life, 50 points, protection wall and paddle
expander.

Installation:
  Just load onto the calculator the Arkanoid.86p file, and the arktitle.86s file.
If you are running a little low on memory, you can delete the arktitle.86s file
to save 2k. Then just use Asm(Arkanoid or run a shell. This version runs badly
with AShell (the very old version that doesnt emulate 85 strings, not ASE) and 


KEYS:
  F1: exit to homescreen and save game (teacher key)
  Left-Right: move the paddle
  Up: hold it down to move the paddle slowly
  More: Pause
  EXIT: normal exit back to homescreen

I dont know of any bugs so far that are terminal (will result in crash) however 
the ball can be hard to see if you dont turn the contrast up, and IMPORTANTLY
for some reason the way some shells work, if you do a Teacher Key, the next 
time that you try to run the shell it may execute my game instead... You will 
have to use the Asm( function on another program to make the shell come up
again, i dont know why this happens (it happens with kirk meyers SimCommunity
2k and any other game that uses a force out, as well). This is not a flaw in Arkanoid,
rather its a side effect of a certain ROM call and the way some shells run games.
Rascall v.9, ASE (every version ive tried), and mosaic shell all run Arkanoid well.

Future versions will only be made if i get emails that say that people want some
more stuff implemented, because I want to program something else now. Please
report any bugs (even though nobody ever does) to james@acz.org

External levels are not included with this version. If people email me saying that
I should add them, then I might add them in a future version.
