Z80 assembly tutorials for programming the Nintendo Gameboy and TI calculators in assembly (1997).

I was 16 years old at the time, and a hobby programmer on an old 486 in my parents basement with no internet access.
Rode my bike to the library to save assemblers and tutorials on floppies to bring home. Good memories.
