        This is a version of the classic game Nibbles. 
  There is nothing very complicated in this source code (included) and it is intended 
  for people who dont know anything to learn assembly from. The source 
  code took a very short time to make, yet is quite small. Without the 
  title picture it is only about 730 bytes! I think that is quite small 
  for a functional game. Anyways...

CONTROLS:
        The direction keys are the only controls, hit the apples 
        to get longer and after a short while, the game will be 
        over (Not real action packed).
